#+Title: Spring Cloud Kubernetes
#+Author: Ioannis Canellos
#+Email: iocanel@gmail.com

* about me
  + principal software engineer @red hat
  + member @apache software foundation
* agenda
  + history
  + brief intro to spring cloud
  + spring cloud kubernetes
  + questions
* history
  + fabric8
  + kubernetes & cdi
  + first attempt to spring / kubernetes
  + kubeflix
* what's spring cloud
  a set of tools on top of spring
  + service registry
  + load balancer
  + circuit breaker
  + configuration management
* what's spring cloud kubernetes
  + implementations
  + starters
  + examples
  of spring-cloud on kubernetes
* deep dive  
  from a zero
  to building a distributed match calculator
  + loadbalancers
  + circuit breakers
  + tracing
  powered by spring cloud kubernetes
* kubernetes client
  + awesome dsl
  + minimal configuration
    + supports service accounts
    + supports .kube/config
    + customizable via application.yml
  + transparent
* discovery client
  + endpoint lookups by id
  + no namespace support
  + no multiport service support
  + is reused by by
    + netflix components
    + sleuth
    + more
* ribbon integration
  client side loadbalancer
  + why?
    + more control
    + weights
    + decouples from infra
  + how does it use discovery client?
* hystrix   
  the circuit breaker pattern
  + stop cascading failures
  + become more responsive
  + gracefully handle errors   
* zipkin    
  distributed system tracing
  + collects timing data
  + microservice troubleshooting

* zipkin and spring cloud kubernetes
  + spring cloud sleuth
    + intercepts calls to collect data  
    + sends data to server  
      
  spring cloud kubernetes tells sleuth how to find zipkin
* if time permits...    
* externalizing configuration
  why?
  + separation of config data
  how?
  + Property Source
  + ConfigMap and Secret
* ConfigMap PropertySource
  how does it work?
  + map per application
  + overrides applcation.yml
  why not just mount the ConfigMap?
  + transparency
  + reload support
* Secret PropertySource
   a ConfigMap for sensitive information
* archaius bridge
  + archais configmap integration
  + supports watches
  + makes sense if archaius is already used
* profile auto configuration    
  + detects kubernetes
  + adds the kubernetes profile
* pod health indicator
  + usable as readiness probe
  + reports health info
  + diagnostic information
* question?
