Making the best out of Jenkins on Kubernetes on Openshift

## Slides
This is a reveal.js presentation, generated by emacs org-mode using [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal).
The generated presentation can be found [here](index.html), while the org-mode file can be found [here](index.org).

The presentation is using a custom [theme](css/themes/jenkinsworld.css) for Jenkins World.

## Docker Images
During the demo two custom images have been used:
- [Custom Jenkins Image](workspace/images/jenkins/Dockerfile)
- [Custom Jenkins Agent Image](workspace/images/agent/Dockerfile)

## Kubernetes Manifests

Configuration for installing Jenkins on Kubernetes: [kubernetes.yml](workspace/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml)

## Demo Project

The demo project which was used for as a target for writing pipelines can be found at: [hello golang](https://github.com/iocanel/hello-go).

## Editor configuration and setup

During the demo [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) has been used, to:

- Build Docker Images
- Apply Kubernetes Manifests
- Write groovy scripts
- Run pipelines from within the editor

Here is my custom [spacemacs configuration](workspace/editor/.spacemacs).
This configuration makes uses of a [custom script to ivoke jenkins pipelines remotely](workspace/editor/run-jenkins-pipeline).
All the groovy and yml snippets used in the demo (are based on yas snippet) can be found [here](workspace/editor/snippets).
